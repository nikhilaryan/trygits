omething in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
new-Phew know I believe her how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
new-Phew know I believe her how
new-Phew're asking me will my love grow
I don't know I don't know
new-Phew stick around now it may show
I don't know I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
new-Phew know I believe her how
